# Swarm Robotics - Active Matter 

Swarm Robotics : distributed online learning in the realm of Active Matter.

2-month end-of-bachelor internship at ESPCI in the [Gulliver laboratory](https://www.gulliver.espci.fr/) with Théo Contentin. The aim was to study the oscillating behavior of kilobots against a wall, to help Jérémy Fersula with his PhD. The initial code came from him and we modified it to try and explain this physical phenomenon.

## Usage

Run Simulations/TKinter_visualization.py to visualize the kilobot, equations that describe the movement can be found in the report. Parameters can be modified around desired values, press enter to simulate. You can also check various output:

- Position in the 2-D arena
- Velocity
- Fourier Transform
- Angle as a function of time
- Angle as a function the velocity
